# Arrays have the best performance and returning them directly avoids excessive copying.

# CA1028:Enum Storage should be Int32

# CA1002: Do not expose generic lists
# In a gamedev context accessing concrete types rather than interfaces
# can make an appreciable perf difference. Also, IList<T> doesn't derive
